# Sakila Actor CRUD

This project is a React application that performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the "actor" table from the Sakila MySQL database.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

```

│   ├── index.html          # Main HTML file serving as the entry point for the React application
│   └── favicon.ico         # Favicon for the application
├── src
│   ├── components
│   │   ├── ActorForm.jsx   # Component for creating and updating actor records
│   │   ├── ActorList.jsx    # Component for displaying a list of actors
│   │   └── ActorDetails.jsx  # Component for showing detailed information about a selected actor
│   ├── services
│   │   └── api.js          # Functions for handling API requests for CRUD operations
│   ├── App.jsx             # Main application component that sets up routing
│   ├── index.js            # Entry point for the React application
│   └── styles
│       └── style.css       # CSS styles for the application
├── package.json            # Configuration file for npm
├── .gitignore              # Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git
└── README.md               # Documentation for the project
```

## Setup Instructions

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
2. Initialize a new npm project:
   ```
   npm init -y
   ```
3. Install React and ReactDOM:
   ```
   npm install react react-dom
   ```
4. Install additional dependencies for development:
   ```
   npm install --save-dev @babel/preset-react
   ```
5. Create a basic Babel configuration file (.babelrc) to transpile JSX:
   ```
   {
     "presets": ["@babel/preset-env", "@babel/preset-react"]
   }
   ```
6. Set up a simple development server using a package like `serve` or `webpack-dev-server` for local development.

## Usage

After completing the setup, you will have a basic React application ready for CRUD operations on the actor table in the Sakila database. You can start the development server and begin interacting with the application.
